# Tridion and third-party libraries

This directory contains the Tridion Content Delivery and Contextual Web Delivery libraries and third-party libraries
that are not available in the Maven Central repository. These libraries need to be installed in your local Maven
repository to be able to compile the Tridion Reference Implementation project.

Make sure you have a JDK and Maven installed and then run `mvn-install.bat` (on Windows) or `mvn-install.sh` (on Linux)
to install these libraries in your local Maven repository. You need to do this only once.
