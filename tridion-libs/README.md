# Tridion and third-party libraries

This directory contains the Tridion Content Delivery libraries that are used by the Tridion Reference Implementation
and the easylicense library and the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver.

The batch file `mvn-install.bat` installs the libraries into your local Maven repository, which is needed to compile
the project with Maven.
