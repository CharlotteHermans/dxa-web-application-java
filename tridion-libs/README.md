 Tridion and third-party libraries
====================================

This directory contains Tridion Content Delivery (cd) and Contextual Web Delivery (cwd) libraries and third-party
libraries that are not available in a publicly accessible Maven repository.

These libraries need to be installed into your local Maven repository before you can successfully build the project.

Run the batch file `mvn-install.bat` (on Windows) or `mvn-install.sh` (on Mac OS X or Linux) to install the libraries
into your local Maven repository. You need to do this only once.
